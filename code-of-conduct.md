# Group Collaboration
1. How do we plan to collaborate?
    We chose to follow the Scrum methodology ascribing roles and responsibilities based on expertise. As a team we will be dividing roles to determine who will be responsible for certain tasks in the development process.We also hold sprint planning meetings during which we list high level tasks that need to be carried out during the sprint and divide them among the team members. In terms of daily meetings, our team has decided to have two weekly meetings rather than everyday. Similar to in a daily scrum, in our meetings each team member discusses what they have done since the previous meeting, what they plan to do before the next meeting, and what issues they are facing. We decided to use a kanban style scheduling medium, Trello, where we place the product backlog and document the progress of each product backlog item.

2. How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
    We have identified the competence of different members and have divided the roles accordingly. Team members are free to share their knowledge and experience that they have with the team for maximum efficiency. Our team members are well aware of the Wow(way of working) this would be essential for carrying out scrum meetings and following agile methodologies.

3. How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
    We will follow a Kanban board to track progress 
    We will add a channel for team members. If someone has a question about which part of the project, leave the questions here, these questions will be answered by other members.

4. What is our usual communication plan?
    We will using the discord as our main communication tool
    besides that Zoom meetings is the mainly meeting and discuss tool
    and if necessary we will have campus meeting
    We will have agile meeting once a week at least
    and we will also have a flexible meeting which is not necessary to join
5. How will we solve conflicts?
    We will create branches for different parts of the development, and remind the team in time after the code is merged to ensure that everyone updates the local code in time.
    For inevitable conflicts in our team program, when conflict has arisen. The team members will communicate and discuss how to solve the problem, we will find the most suitable solution for us, otherwise, We ask the TA for help.
