# code-of-conduct
1. How do we plan to collaborate?
    We chose to follow the Scrum methodology ascribing roles and responsibilities based on expertise. As a team we will be dividing roles to determine who will be responsible for certain tasks in the development process.We also hold sprint planning meetings during which we list high level tasks that need to be carried out during the sprint and divide them among the team members. In terms of daily meetings, our team has decided to have two weekly meetings rather than everyday. Similar to in a daily scrum, in our meetings each team member discusses what they have done since the previous meeting, what they plan to do before the next meeting, and what issues they are facing. We decided to use a kanban style scheduling medium, Trello, where we place the product backlog and document the progress of each product backlog item.

2. How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
    We have identified the competence of different members and have divided the roles accordingly. Team members are free to share their knowledge and experience that they have with the team for maximum efficiency. Our team members are well aware of the Wow(way of working) this would be essential for carrying out scrum meetings and following agile methodologies.

3. How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
    We will divide the project into sprints and follow a Kanban board to track progress increasing tracability. Kanban Board will contain task cards where team members will be assigned to tasks this would allow team members to check and visualise an ovierview of the prject. For every sprint, Sprint planning and sprint retrosepectives will be held to reflect and plan for current and future sprints.
    

4. What is our usual communication plan?
    We will using the discord as our main communication tool
    besides that Zoom meetings is the mainly meeting and discuss tool
    and if necessary we will have campus meeting
    We will have weekly scrum meetings mandatory for all team members
    Flexible and codealong sessions will be held throughout sprints.
    For onsite communication our team plans to hold one the sprint retrospectives in person this will allow the us to reflect back on our progress help us identify areas of improvements. we plan to sync the sprint retrospective right after a TA meeting. As TA is defined as a stakeholder we plan to take feedback on our delivery and decide if we have achieved DoD.
    
    
5. How will we solve conflicts?
    A we are are group of 5 and we will all be developing locally working on separate items related to the project therefore code pushes to main may hamper the version of eachothers code and pulling new code while pushing without creating backups may cause code to be lost making the process inefficient. To prevent such occurances we want to have a version control We will create branches for different parts of the development, and remind the team in time after the code is merged to ensure that everyone updates the local code in time.
    For inevitable conflicts in our team program, when conflict has arisen. The team members will communicate and discuss how to solve the problem, we will find the most suitable solution for us, otherwise, we will seek assistance from the TA.
