# Cyber Physical Systems and Systems of Systems

## üí° Description

The main idea of this project is to develop an algorithm that can analyze the video feed of a car and control the steering wheel angle.
The video feed contains a roadway with cones that the self driving vehicle is supposed to avoid using our algorithm. The project will be running through a docker container.

## üõ† Features
For feature development we would want to follow the 3 steps described in the following:

* a)	Requirements engineering - Teamwork is the most basic requirement when creating a new feature. This is because new questions arise during development and because requirements change throughout the process of development. We plan to have sprint retrospectives with stakeholders to stay in sync with the requirements they have agreed upon and if there are new requirements, we ask the user are they satisfied.

* b)	Proof of concept - With a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP), we can put our preliminary research into practice and see whether your ideas work in real life. We check if we have met DoD as per stakeholders

* c)	Production ‚Äì We rollout our software in the production/master branch and monitor results if we notice unexpected bugs or any disruption in CI.
